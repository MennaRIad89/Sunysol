👩‍🦳 About Me
Hi, I'm your guide — and your bridge to the UAE.
My name is Menna , and for nearly a decade, I've been turning trips into unforgettable stories for Spanish-speaking travelers across the UAE. As a certified tour guide in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai "since 2019", I specialize in delivering group or private, in-depth, and fully guided experiences in Spanish and English.
Over the years, I've built strong partnerships with top travel agencies from Latin America and Spain — but what truly drives me is the connection I build with every traveler who joins my tours.
Whether it's strolling through the historic alleyways of the Old Souk, watching the sunset in the desert, or exploring the majestic Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, I don't just show you the sights — I share the stories, the culture, and the hidden gems that make this country so extraordinary.
I also work closely with a trusted network of Spanish-speaking guides, luxury transport providers, and local operators. This allows me to offer everything from group adventures to fully customized VIP experiences — complete with private cars, buses, attraction bookings, and skip-the-line access to many of Dubai and Abu Dhabi's top landmarks.
With me, you don't just visit the UAE.
You experience it — personally, passionately, and in your own language.
