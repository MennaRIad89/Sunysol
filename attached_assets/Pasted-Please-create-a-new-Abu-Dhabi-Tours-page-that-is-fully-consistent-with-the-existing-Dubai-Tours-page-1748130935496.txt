Please create a new Abu Dhabi Tours page that is fully consistent with the existing Dubai Tours page. Follow the same layout, design, and structure exactly as it is on the Dubai Tours page. This includes:

A simple page header with a white background and the page title.

Tour preview cards for each tour, with an image, tour title, short description, duration, pickup information, and a toggle icon to expand.

Expandable sections for each tour with:

The itinerary in bullet points.

The "What's Included" and "What's Not Included" sections in two columns with tick and cross icons.

A "Book This Tour" button linking to the contact section.

Use the same fonts, button styles, layout, and expand/collapse animations as the Dubai Tours page.

For the two tours, use these exact details:

No need for SEO tweaks at this stage; I will handle that later. Focus on creating the page structure and interactivity exactly like the Dubai Tours page.
