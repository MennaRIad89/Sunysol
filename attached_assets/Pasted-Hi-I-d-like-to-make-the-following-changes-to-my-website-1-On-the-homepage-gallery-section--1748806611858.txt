Hi! I’d like to make the following changes to my website:

1) On the homepage gallery section:  
Problem: Images are stacked vertically; the page becomes too long.
Desired: A horizontal scrollable gallery (carousel style), where images are beside each other, and you can scroll left/right.

- Change the current stacked layout to a **horizontal scrollable gallery (carousel style)**, where images are beside each other.  
- Add **left/right arrows** outside the gallery for scrolling.  
- On click, open the image in a **lightbox** with its own navigation.

2) For the **"Book This Tour"** and **"View Gallery"** buttons on tour pages (like Dubai Tours page):  
- **Center-align** these two buttons horizontally.  
- Keep the **orange button** styling for "Book This Tour" (with the white text and orange background).  
- For the **"View Gallery"** button:  
  - Improve its visual design so it doesn't look like plain text on a white background.  
  - Make it more like a **secondary button**—for example, a subtle border, slight background color (like light grey), or matching rounded shape to the "Book This Tour" button, but less visually dominant.

3)For all per-tour gallery pages (e.g., Dubai Modern, Abu Dhabi heritage edition):  
- Add a consistent **"Back to [Tour Page]" button** at the bottom.  
- The button should navigate to the corresponding tour page (e.g., Dubai Modern → Dubai Tours page).  
- **Remove the "Ready to Book This Tour?" footer section** entirely from all gallery pages.

4) For all other pages (e.g., tour pages):  
- Also **remove the "Ready to Book This Tour?" footer section**.  
- Only keep the **"Back to Tour Page" button** where it makes sense.

5) Ensure all **page titles** (h1, h2) are **consistent in color, font size, and weight** across the site—match the design of the homepage hero section.

6) Make sure everything is **responsive** across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

7) make sure all translation for the gallaries pages and sections is working, i did some but please finetune it and add the missings

Thanks!
