Please adjust the Guest Reviews section as follows:

1. Keep the Split Layout Consistent
Keep the original split layout: On desktop, the reviews cards should remain on the left, and the "Share Your Experience" form should remain on the right—just like the Contact Us page.

Do not combine the reviews cards with "Stories from our Adventures" or the "Happy Travelers" and "Exceptional Experiences" slogans into a single block.

The reviews cards, form, and section slogans should remain visually separated for clarity.

2. Reviews Carousel Functionality
The reviews on the left should be displayed in a horizontal carousel:

Show 1.5 to 2 reviews at a time (depending on screen size).

Add left/right arrows to let users scroll through reviews horizontally.

Hide the extra reviews out of view until the user clicks an arrow.

Do not make the cards stack vertically under each other.

On mobile: Show one review at a time and allow swipe/arrow navigation.

3. Premium Card Design
Keep the new, premium card look:

Rounded corners, soft shadow, and light background.

Guest name prominent, avatar/initials/flag, bold stars, clear review text, and image gallery row.

Add more spacing between cards, lighter feeling.

(Optional) Show date and country.

4. Slogans Placement
The "Happy Travelers" and "Exceptional Experiences" row should appear below the reviews carousel, not next to or merged with the review cards.

5. General Notes
Don’t let the review cards take over the full section width—keep the left-right split layout as originally designed.

Ensure the section looks clean and not overcrowded, even if there are many reviews.

The “See All Reviews” button should still link to a page showing all reviews in full detail.

In short:

Keep the desktop split (reviews left, form right).

Show reviews in a horizontal scrolling row, not vertical stacking.

Do not combine with slogans or adventure stories.

Place slogans under the reviews, outside the split section.

Example Visual Guidance
“Guest Reviews” section should look like a two-column layout:

Left: horizontally-scrollable reviews carousel (showing 2 at a time).

Right: share your experience form.

Slogans underneath the reviews, spanning the whole section
