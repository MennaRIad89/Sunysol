Implementation Tips:
•	Use only HTML forms and basic CSS.
•	No carousels or fancy layouts—just 2–3 “review cards” side by side or stacked.
•	Wrap everything in a container <div> with padding and max-width so nothing overflows.
•	For photo upload: <input type="file" accept="image/*">
•	Start with hard-coded reviews, add dynamic later if needed.
•	Ensure translation is applied for Spanish and English 
•	“See all reviews” can just be an <a> styled as a button; full page is just a list.
•	Style tip: Use rounded review cards with a soft shadow, a default user icon if no photo, and a green submit button (same green as WhatsApp button).
•	Mobile: Double check that nothing overflows the screen and the layout stays clean.
